Hello! I am Hari,

I am a third-year **Bachelor of Information** student at the University of Toronto.

Before starting at the Faculty of Information, I was **specializing in Digital Enterprise Management**, where I learned how to use digital technologies to solve business management and organizational problems in creative and innovative ways. Now, I am exploring technology through a design and user-centric lens and learning how to translate ideas into impactful digital products.
