<h3>Hello! I am Hari,</h3>

I am a third-year **Bachelor of Information** student at the University of Toronto. Before starting at the Faculty of Information, I was **specializing in Digital Enterprise Management**, where I learned how to use digital technologies to solve business management and organizational problems in creative and innovative ways. Now, I am exploring technology through a **user-centric design lens** and learning how to translate data into **impactful projects**.
